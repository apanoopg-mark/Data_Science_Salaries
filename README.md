#📊 Data Science Salaries Analysis

This project explores and analyzes Data Science salary data using Python.
The main goal is to clean, preprocess, and prepare the dataset for reliable analysis and modeling.

##📁 Project Overview

Real-world datasets are often messy. In this project, I focused on data cleaning and preprocessing to make the salary dataset accurate and analysis-ready.

Key tasks included:

Detecting and handling missing values

Identifying and removing duplicate records

Detecting and treating outliers

Preparing clean data for further analysis and visualization

##🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy – numerical operations

SciPy / Z-score – outlier detection

Scikit-learn – preprocessing and scaling

##🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
###1️⃣ Handling Missing Values

Checked for null or missing values in all columns

Applied appropriate strategies such as:

Dropping rows with excessive missing data

Filling missing numerical values when necessary

###2️⃣ Removing Duplicates

Identified duplicate rows in the dataset

Removed them to prevent bias and inaccurate analysis

###3️⃣ Outlier Detection & Treatment

Used statistical methods such as Z-score to detect extreme values

Outliers were handled to reduce their impact on the analysis

#📈 Outcome

After preprocessing:

The dataset became clean, consistent, and reliable

Ready for:

Salary trend analysis

Role-based salary comparison

Machine learning modeling
